<h1 align="center">A Tip Calculator Here For the Holidays</h1>

<p id="lead">This is a tip calculator that I made in my JS course on Udemy. It
calculates the restaurant totals of two, young men and when they go out with 
their families out to eat for the holidays.</p>

<p id="lead">This project was kinda hard to make, but I tried it and I succeeded!!!</p>
